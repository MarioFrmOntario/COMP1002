    <h3> Why I love this song</h3>
        <p> I chose this particular song because i've had a lot of history with it. Its lifted up some <br>of the best times in my life and got me through some of the darkest times as well. The <br> lyrics have personal value and the instrumentals are incredible.From my perspective its an <br>masterful piece of music and goes down incredibly smooth with a bit of greenery and a nice view.<br></p>

    <h3>Time Flies Lyrics</h3>
        <p>I was born in '67<br>
        The year of Sgt. Pepper<br>
        And Are You Experienced<br></p>
        <p>
        Into a suburban heaven<br>
        Yeah, it should've been forever<br>
        It all seems to make so much sense<br></p>
        <p>
         But after a while<br>
        You realize time flies<br></p>
        <p>
        And the best thing that you can do<br>
        Is take whatever comes to you<br>
        'Cause time flies<br></p>
        <p>
        She said "Luck is what you make it<br>
        You just reach out and take it<br>
        Now let's dance a while"<br></p>
        <p>
        She said "nothing ever happens<br>
        If you don't make it happen<br>
        And if you can't laugh and smile"<br></p>
        <p>
        But after a while<br>
        You realize time flies<br></p>
        <p>
        And the best thing that you can do<br>
        Is take whatever comes to you<br>
        'Cause time flies<br></p>
        <p>
        And laughing in the summer showers<br>
        That's still the way I see you now<br></p>
        <p>
        How does time break down?<br>
        With no marker, things slow down<br>
        A conference of the strange<br>
        And your family is deranged<br></p>
        <p>
        I could tell you what I'm thinking<br>
        While we sit here drinking<br>
        But I'm not sure where to start<br></p>
        <p>
        You see there's something wrong here<br>
        I'm sorry if I'm not clear<br>
        Can you stop smoking your cigar<br></p>
        <p>
        But after a while<br>
        You realize time flies<br></p>
        <p>
        And the best thing that you can do<br>
        Is take whatever comes to you<br>
        'Cause time flies<br></p>
        <p>
        And the coat you wore to Alton Towers<br>
        Is still the way I see you now<br></p>
